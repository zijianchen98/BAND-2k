# BAND-2k Database
A Banding Artifact Noticeable Database for Deep Learning of Image Quality Assessment

## Introduction
We constructed so far the largest banding-affected database and named it the Banding Artifact Noticeable 2k Database (BAND-2k). It contains 2,000 distorted images clipped from over 870 source videos with four encoding schemes: H.264, H.265, VP9, and bit-depth manipulation. A total of 44,371 scores were collected by 23 non-experienced subjects in an offline laboratory environment.
