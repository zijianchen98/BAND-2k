# BAND-2k Database
A banding artifact database for Deep Learning of Image Quality Assessment. We will opensource the database and code in the future.

## Introduction
This is a repository of the paper [**"BAND-2k: Banding Artifact Noticeable Database for Banding Detection and Quality Assessment"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17752) (authored by **Zijian Chen, Wei Sun, Jun Jia, Fangfang Lu, Zicheng Zhang, Jing Liu, Ru Huang, Xiongkuo Min, and Guangtao Zhai*.** )

We constructed so far the largest banding-affected database,  named Banding Artifact Noticeable 2k Database (BAND-2k). It contains 2,000 distorted images clipped from over 870 source videos with four encoding schemes: H.264, H.265, VP9, and bit-depth manipulation. A total of 44,371 scores were collected by 23 non-experienced subjects in an offline laboratory environment.

## Database Link
We have uploaded the BAND-2k database to both OneDrive and Baidu Netdisk, and the download links are as follows:
